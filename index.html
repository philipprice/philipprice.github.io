			Philip Price and I worked together at a critical time for my firm looking to expand into new markets. He applied enthusiasm and motivation to client and service provider alike with remarkable energy levels. Known and trusted by very senior people in a number of industries, my firm was able to rely on Philip to arrange a diary and book appropriate venues between well suited parties. More than this, his wide number of interests and impeccable network makes spending time with Philip and his contact base an investment to enjoy as well as to work at.
